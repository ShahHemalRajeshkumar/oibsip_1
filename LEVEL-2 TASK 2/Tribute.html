                <h2>Narendranath Datta</h2>
                <p>Swami Vivekananda was a great philosopher, Hindu monk, and spiritual leader who believed in the mantra of simple living and high thinking. He was born on January 12 in a traditional Bengali family in Kolkata. Swami Vivekananda moved the world with his discourse of modern Vedanta and Raj Yoga at a very early age.At the age of eight in 1871, Vivekananda was enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Institution and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. He was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science.He wanted that education which enabled one to stand on his own legs. He said, 'We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet.Swami Vivekananda was one of the greatest spiritual masters India has produced. His life, teachings and messages have inspired millions through several generations. He was the fountainhead of wisdom and inspiration. He could ignite hearts with spiritual quest and also convey lofty thoughts in a lucid but powerful way.He was also highly intelligent and this could be due to his mother's spiritual influence and his father's modern approach what with him being an attorney in Calcutta High Court.Vivekananda's meditation is practiced under the two themes of “Meditation according to Yoga” which is considered a practical and mystical approach, and of “Meditation according to Vedanta” which means a philosophical and transcendental approach.</p>
